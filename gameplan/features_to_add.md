List of features that I think have potential value:
1. Variable rates of scraping
2. Scraping using a VPN (like NordVPN). Obviously test and make sure CFP-RSVP is NOT blocking VPN traffic already.
3. Add mobile app to view data
4. Display price history for 100 and 300 levels per team
5. Display prices for the 6 tickets shown for each level/team
6. Have mobile app UI to pick certain teams as 'ON' or 'OFF' that allows me ONLY scrape those teams (no real need to scrape G5 teams every 5 mins for example). Probably only about 25-30 teams I need to focus on.
7. Better estimation logic for determining the expected price of the CFP National Championship ticket in Las Vegas.
8. Reference Sportsbooks to calculate the "best value" RSVPs.
9. Reference Sportsbooks to calculate RSVPs as under/over valued (will need to keep fan bases in mind - ex: texas).
10. List of the "most financially gifted" fanbases (reference ticket prices for team's games over the past 5 years - highest average ticket price for ranked games or 5 biggest matchups).

## Scenario Calculations

### Scenario 1: If I Bought 2 of Each RSVP (National Championship Teams)

Assuming most expensive pairs:
```
Options Cost: $850 + $720 + $464 + $472 + $312 + $276 + $380 + $300 = $3,774
4× Face Value 300L Tickets: $2,000
Total Cost: $5,774
Cost per Championship Ticket: $5,774 ÷ 4 = $1,443.50
```

### Scenario 2: UGA + OSU + BAMA (300 Level)

```
2 RSVPs: $360 + $850 + $380 = $1,590
Cost per ticket (option): $1,590 ÷ 2 = $795 (vs $1,100 option)
Cost per ticket (with FV): $1,590 + $1,000 = $2,590 ÷ 2 = $1,295 (vs $1,600 ticket)
```

### Scenario 3: UGA + OSU + BAMA (100 Level)

```
3 RSVPs: $720 + $1,200 + $570 = $2,490
Cost per ticket (option): $2,490 ÷ 2 = $1,245 (vs $2,000 option)
Cost per ticket (with FV): $2,490 + $1,750 = $4,240 ÷ 2 = $2,120 (vs $2,800 ticket)
```

### Scenario 4: OSU + ND + BAMA + UGA (100 Level)

```
4 RSVPs: $1,200 + $600 + $570 + $720 = $3,090
Cost per ticket (option): $3,090 ÷ 2 = $1,545 (vs $2,000 option)
Cost per ticket (with FV): $3,090 + $1,750 = $4,840 ÷ 2 = $2,420 (vs $2,800)
```

### Scenario 5: OSU + A&M (100 Level)

```
2 RSVPs: $1,200 + $1,680 = $2,880
Cost per ticket: $2,880 ÷ 2 = $1,440 (vs $2,000 option)
```

### Scenario 6: UGA + OU + GT + MISS + BAMA + OSU (300 Level)

```
3 RSVPs: $514 + $252 + $850 = $1,616
Cost per ticket: $1,616 ÷ 2 = $808 (vs $1,100 option)
```

## Final Thoughts & Lessons Learned

### Key Takeaways
